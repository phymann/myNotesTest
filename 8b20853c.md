# writing shell scripts

The shell is both a command line interface to the system and a scripting language interpreter.

To run a shell script, 3 things are needed:

## write a script

Add a _shebang_, namely,

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```

in the first line, used to tell the kernel the name of the interpreter that should be used to execute the script that follows.

## make the script executable

```shell
chmod 755 hello
```

## put the script somewhere the shell can find it

```shell
echo $PATH
```

then mv it there; or add the path,

```shell
export PATH=~/bin:"$PATH"
. .bashrc
```

here `.` is a synonym for the source command.

Some conventions:

- `~/bin` is good for personal use

- `/usr/local/bin` is for everyone

- `/sbin` is used for system administrator
